
Dear Dr. Bryce,

We have developed a DMSO box and we thought  that it would be a good idea to
be included in the AMBER Parameter Database. Please find attached the FRCMOD
and OFF files.

The parameters for the DMSO unit were taken from:
Thomas Fox and Peter A. Kollman (J. Phys. Chem. B., 1998, 102, 8070-8079)

After the initial unit was prepared and the atomic charges calculated the
DMSO box was built. After minimisation and 800 ps dynamic equilibration
(density:1.0942g/ml) the equilibrated box (.pdb file) was read back in leap.
The periodic box was constructed using the setbox <unit> center command. The
library and topology were saved. Then the box dimensions in the library file
were manually edited based on the box dimensions of the equilibrated .rst
file.

I hope that the information I have provided is sufficient. If more data is
needed please feel free to contact me.

Best wishes,

John

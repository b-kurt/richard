Molecular mechanical models for organic and biological systems going beyond the atom centered two body additive
  approximation: Aqueous solution free energies of methanol and N-methyl acetamide, nucleic acid base, and amide
            hydrogen bonding and chloroform/water partition coefficients of the nucleic acid bases
</b><br>

We have developed a methodology to derive RESP charges for molecular mechanical models that include "lone pairs" on lone-pair
donor sites and atom-centered polarizabilities. This approach uses a very high level ab initio cc-pVTZ basis set,(1) where the
multipole moments of the molecules are as accurate as possible. The partial charges are derived self-consistently so that the
model, whose electrostatic potential comes from both partial charges and induced dipoles, reproduces the quantum mechanical
electrostatic potential. We then study the ability of such models to reproduce the aqueous solvation free energy of methanol and
N-methyl acetamide (NMA), the base pair hydrogen bonding of the 26 base pairs analyzed by Hobza et al, and the
chloroform/water partition coefficients of the five N-methyl substituted nucleic acid bases. The base pair H-bond energies are
described as well as the atom centered additive model, after modifying the van der Waals parameter on the N-H to give
reasonable base pair H-bond distances. The experimental solvation free energies (gas --> water) of methanol and NMA are well
described, and the water/CHCl3 partition coefficients are improved over the additive model, without any parameter changes. (C)

Theoretical study of anion binding to calix[4]pyrrole: the effects of solvent, fluorine substitution, cosolute, and water traces
</b><br>
The binding of different anions to calix[4]pyrrole has been studied by means of molecular dynamics coupled to thermodynamic integration
calculations. The effect of different apolar solvents, octafluoro substitution, and the change in binding free energy derived from the presence of
cosolute and water traces (the hydrated salt used to introduce the anion in the solution) were examined. Calculations allow us to rationalize the
differential binding of ions to calix[4]pyrrole and octafluorocalix[4]pyrrole as well as to predict the behavior in new solvents for which
experimental data are not available yet. It is found that both calix[4]pyrrole and octafluorocalix[4]pyrrole have a dramatic preference for F- in the
gas phase and pure aprotic solvents, but the situation can change dramatically in protic solvents or in the presence of the hydrated cation which is
used as cosolute of the anion. Overall, our results provide interesting clues for a better understanding of the process detected experimentally as
"binding".

If you need more than one DCMBOX to fully solvate your system, some "strange" lanes may appear between adjacent boxes. This arises because of the closeness parameter
employed by the "solvatebox" leap command. The system is easily brought to the right density by a 100-200ps short MD.

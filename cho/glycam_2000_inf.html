<b>Relative energies of binding for antibody-carbohydrate-antigen 
          complexes computed from free-energy simulations</b><br>
Free-energy perturbation (FEP) simulations have been applied to a series of 
analogues of the natural trisaccharide epitope of Salmonella serotype B 
bound to a fragment of the monoclonal anti-Salmonella antibody Se155-4. 
This system was selected in order to assess the ability of free-energy 
perturbation (FEP) simulations to predict carbohydrate-protein interaction 
energies. The ultimate goal is to use FEP simulations to aid in the design of 
synthetic high affinity ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins. The 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in the explicit 
presence of water molecules, at room temperature. The AMBER force field, 
with the GLYCAM parameter set for oligosaccharides, was employed. In 
contrast to many modeling protocols, FEP simulations are capable of 
including the effects of entropy, arising from differential ligand flexibilities and 
solvation properties. The experimental binding affinities are all close in value, 
resulting in small relative free energies of binding. Many of the Delta Delta G 
values are on the order of 0-1 kcal mol(-1), making their accurate 
calculation particularly challenging. The simulations were shown to 
reasonably reproduce the known geometries of the ligands and the Ligand-
protein complexes. A model for the conformational behavior of the unbound 
antigen is proposed that is consistent with the reported NMR data. The best 
agreement with experiment was obtained when histidine 97H was treated as 
fully protonated, for which the relative binding energies were predicted to 
well within 1 kcal mol(-1). To our knowledge this is the first report of FEP 
simulations applied to an oligosaccharide-protein complex.

N.B.  Correct rotational behavior for O-C-C-O fragments requires SCEE=SCNB=1.0.  This is
in contrast to "standard" AMBER, in which it is normal to set SCEE=1.2 and SCNB=2.0.  Unless
you are attempting to generate rotamer populations, it is OK to use the "standard" values.
Using non-standard values (SCEE=SCNB=1.0) may be unacceptable when a protein is also present.<p>

Insight into the stabilization of A-DNA by specific ion association: spontaneous B-DNA to A-DNA transitions observed in molecular
                 dynamics simulations of d[ACCCGCGGGT](2) in the presence of hexaamminecobalt(III)

Background: Duplex DNA is more than a simple information carrier. The sequence-dependent structure and its inherent deformability, in
concert with the subtle modulating effects of the environment, play a crucial role in the regulation and packaging of DNA. Recent advances in
force field and simulation methodologies allow molecular dynamics simulations to now represent the specific effects of the environment. An
understanding of the environmental dependence of DNA structure gives insight into how histones are able to package DNA, how various
proteins are able to bind and modulate nucleic acid structure and will ultimately aid the design of molecules to package DNA for more
effective gene therapy.

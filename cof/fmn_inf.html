<b>A molecular dynamics simulation of the flavin mononucleotide-RNA aptamer
complex</b><br>
We report on an unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation of the flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN)-RNA aptamer. The simulated average structure 
maintains both cross-strand and intermolecular FMN-RNA nuclear 
Overhauser effects from the nmr experiments and has all qualitative features 
of the nmr structure including the G10-U12-A25 base triple and the A13-
G24, A8-G28, and G9-G27 mismatches. However the relative orientation 
of the hairpin loop to the remaining part of the molecule differs from the nmr 
structure. The simulation predicts that the flexible phosphoglycerol part of 
FMN moves toward G27 and forms hydrogen bonds. There are structurally 
long-lived water molecules in the FMN binding pocket forming hydrogen 
bonds within FMN and between FMN and RNA. In addition, long-lived 
water is found bridging primarily RNA backbone atoms. A general feature 
of the environment of long-lived "structural" water is at least two and in most 
cases three or four potential acceptor atoms. The 2'-OH group of RNA 
usually acts as an acceptor in interactions with the solvent. There are almost 
no intrastrand O2'H(n)... O4'(n + 1) hydrogen bonds within the RNA 
backbone. In the standard case the preferred orientation of the 2'-OH 
hydrogen atoms is approximately toward O3' of the same nucleotide. 
However, a relatively large number of conformations with the backbone 
torsional angle gamma in the trans orientation is found. A survey of all 
experimental RNA x-ray structures shows that this backbone conformation 
occurs but is less frequent than found in the simulation. Experimental nmr 
RNA aptamer structures have a higher fraction of this conformation as 
compared to the x-ray structures. The backbone conformation of nucleotide 
n + 1 with the torsional angle gamma in the trans orientation leads to a 
relatively short distance between 2'-OH(n) and O5'(n + 1), enabling 
hydrogen-bond formation. In this case the preferred orientation of the 2'-
OH hydrogen atom is approximately toward O5'(n + 1). We find two 
relatively short and dynamically stable types of backbone-backbone next-
neighbor contacts, namely C2'(H)(n)... O4'(n + 1) and C5'(H)(n + 1)... 
O2'(n). These interactions may affect both backbone rigidity and 
thermodynamic stability of RNA helical structures. (C) 1999 John Wiley &

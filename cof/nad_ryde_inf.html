Force-field parameters for NADH, NAD+, NADP+ and NADPH are
taken from the amber adenine and ribose input (residue RA5 in
all_nuc94.in) with the nicotinamide and pyrophosphate moieties added using
quantum chemically calculated charges with the RESP method and RHF/6-31G*
calculations. They are fully compatible to Amber 4.1 and the Cornell et
al. 1995 force field, but they can also be used with later verions of
Amber. For NADPX, the charge of the 2'-phosphate group is not clear
(pKa=6-7) so two different molecules were developed, one with a total
charge of -2 and the other with a total charge of -3.

It should be noted that Charmm22 force field parameters for NAD+ and
NADH were recently published: Paverlites et al, J. Comput. Chem. 18(97)
221-239. Their force constants and equilibrium values are probably more
accurate, whereas our charges are better and more compatible with Amber.

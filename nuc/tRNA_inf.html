<b>Molecular dynamics simulations find that 3' phosphoramidate modified DNA duplexes undergo a B to A transition and normal DNA duplexes an A to B transition</b></br>
We present unrestrained molecular dynamics studies on a deoxyribose dodecamer duplex d(CGCGAAT-TCGCG)(2) and its phosphoramidate
(replacing O3' by NH) analog using particle mesh Ewald electrostatics(1) and the Cornell et al. forte field.(2) The simulations were carried
out beginning in both canonical A and B forms, which differ in RMS position by similar to 6.5 Angstrom. These simulations, which were
carried out for similar to 1-1.5 ns, are consistent with experiment in that the unmodified dodecamer, whether started in A or B DNA,
converges to a B structure which is closer to the observed X-ray structure (9bna) than canonical B. On the other hand, the phosphoramidate
modified duplex, whether starred in A or B forms, converges to an A form. In this duplex, however, the structure from the simulation begun
in the Ii form has a dependence on the initial location of the N-H hydrogen. In one of our simulations, we find base pair opening and closing
at the end of the duplex. Specifically, in the simulation of d(CGCGAATTCGCG)(2) begun in the A form, base pair opening of the terminal
G-C base pair occurs at 400 ps, and then the bases remain unpaired for 700 ps before reclosing. -->

Charges were calculated with the RESP procedure, at the HF/6-31G* level.<p>

Force constants and atom types were hand-assigned, based by analogy to
the parm99 force field.<p>

A artificial bond between P and H5T in the 5' guanosine nucleotide was 
added to prevent distortion of the terminal OH group; this is similar
to the artificial H-H bond in water that keeps it rigid.<p>

An accompanying <a href="tRNA.leaprc">leap script</a> is also available.<p>

<b>AMBER force field parameters for phosphorylated amino acids in different
protonation states: phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine and
phosphohistidine</b><br>
We report a consistent set of AMBER force-field parameters for the most common phosphorylated amino acids, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphohistidine in different protonation states. The calculation of atomic charges followed the original restrained electrostatic potential fitting procedure used to determine the charges for the parm94/99 parameter set, taking alpha-helical and beta-strand conformations of the corresponding ACE-/NME-capped model peptide backbone into account. Missing force-field parameters were taken directly from the general AMBER force field (gaff) and the parm99 data set with minor modifications, or were newly generated based on ab initio calculations for model systems. Final parameters were validated by geometry optimizations and molecular-dynamics simulations. Template libraries for the phosphorylated amino acids in Leap format and corresponding frcmod parameter files are made available.<p>

We developed AMBER force field parameters for the most common 
phospho-amino acids in two different protonation states.<p>

All new parameters were calculated according to procedures used for the 
generation of the parm94/99 parameters and recommended in the AMBER 
mannual. RESP charges were generated by performing a three stage RESP 
fit on  two HF/6-31G* optimized structures representing the 
alpha-helical and beta-strand conformations of the phospho-amino acids. 
Missing bond and torsion parameters were developed by fitting AMBER 
energies onto ab initio (GAUSSIAN) calculated ones.<p>

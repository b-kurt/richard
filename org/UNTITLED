Dear Richard,

Thanks for putting the parameters on the website. Looks good.
I noticed another minor glitch in the published charges, which
is ok in the input files, so if you could add the following to
the errata, please:

In [2000.4] there are two errors concerning the charges. One for the
amide fragment, where the alpha amide carbon is not charged -0.323 but
+0.323. One for the phosphine-oxide, where the bottom HA is indicated
as 0.0122 and should be 0.122.

More importantly there is a (small) error in the charges in PREPAMI.DAT,
so I attach a corrected version.

Another remark concerning the website: the third lanthanide cation is
Ytterbium Yb3+ and not Yttrium Y3+.

All the best,
  Marc
